Although the SARIMA model performed better than the ARIMA model, due to the added seasonal Moving Average term, we can gauge our understanding of the monthly terrorist attacks better by including **endogenous variables**! Endogenous variables are those that are determined within the system being studied and are influenced by other variables in the system. These variables are typically modeled as being interdependent and are affected by changes in the values of other variables. In the case of terrorist attacks and casualties suffered from them, potential endogenous variables could include USA military expenditure, non-immigrant admissions data, and the performance of major weapons contracts, including Lockheed\tMartin,\tBoeing, and Raytheon Technologies. With the help of a literature review, [@Lit] it can be reinforced thoroughly and plausibly that the aforementioned endogenous variables have, in fact, not only been employed but also found to have effects related to terrorism in prior research.\n\nCode for this section can be found [here](https://tegveerg.georgetown.domains/Time-Series-Project/ARMAX-SARIMAX-VAR.qmd)\n\n## Literature Review {#Lit}\n\nThe Stimson Study Group's Report on Counterterrorism Spending [@stimson2018counterterroism] in the post-9/11 era provides valuable insights into the amount of resources the United States devotes to counterterrorism efforts. The report found that the US government spent over USD2.8 trillion on counterterrorism efforts from 2002 to 2017, which represents a significant portion of the country's overall military budget during that period. Specifically, the report notes that counterterrorism spending accounted for 17% to 23% of the US defense budget each year between 2002 and 2017. Hartung (2021) [@hartung_2021] found that the \"Global War on Terror\", which emerged in the early 2000s as a result of the 9/11 attacks, had a significant impact on the political environment, resulting in a surge in the Pentagon's budget, the largest component of the US military budget. This increased funding was largely directed towards **military contractors, Lockheed\tMartin,\tBoeing,\tGeneral\tDynamics,\tRaytheon Technologies,\tand\tNorthrop\tGrumman**, who were enlisted to aid in the efforts. Since Fiscal Year 2001, the total expenditures of the Pentagon for all purposes have surpassed USD14.1 trillion (measured in 2021 dollars). Out of this sum, USD4.4 trillion was used for weapons procurement and research and development (R&D), which mainly benefited corporate contractors. **The rest of the funds were utilized for** paying and providing benefits to military and civilian personnel and other expenses, necessary for **operating and maintaining the United States military**. Congressional\tResearch Service (CRS) estimates\tthat in\tFY2020, the\tspending for\tcontractors\tgrew to\t$420 billion - well over half of the total Pentagon budget. Therefore, the biggest\tfinancial\tbeneficiaries of the post-9/11 military spending surge have been the aforementioned weapons contractors.\n\nFurthermore, several papers have discussed and analyzed the relation between military spending or counterterrorism efforts with transnational terrorism prior to the 9/11 attacks. Li and Schaub (2004) [@LiandSchaub2004] employed *GOVCAPABILITY*, a control variable in their Pooled Time-Series Analysis , that comprised military manpower and military expenditures for 112 countries from 1975 to 1997. Because the variable captured state military and economic strength, it represented a proxy that the government could use for combating terrorism. Gaibulloev, K., Sandler, T., & Sul, D. (2014) [@gaibulloev_sandler_sul_2014Such] challenged extant literature about terrorism and its impact on economic growth that suffered from Nickell Bias, a type of bias that arises in statistical models when the independent variable is measured with error, and cross-sectional dependence, a statistical issue that arises in panel data analysis when the individual units (e.g., countries or firms) in the panel are not completely independent of one another. They mentioned that cross-sectional dependence is apt to affect other variables, such as democracy, threat, **military spending**, and financial measures. However, when Nickell bias and cross-sectional dependence are addressed, terrorism has no influence whatsoever on economic growth.\n\nTherefore, the perused literature about counterterrorism and military spending underscores the importance of counterterrorism efforts, including funding weapons contractors, in shaping the country's military spending priorities, particularly in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. By highlighting the amount of resources devoted to counterterrorism, these reports and papers help us understand how the overall US budget and military budget are allocated and the policy decisions that drive those allocations. However, it might also possible that during the VAR model building phase of this section, we find that military spending may not be a significant indicator of the number of casualties stemming from terrorist attacks in the Global Terrorism Database™ (GTD) [@GTD].\n\nSecondly, Nowrasteh (2019) [@nowrasteh_2019] found, by carefully analyzing the GTD, that the chance of being murdered by a tourist on a B visa, the most common tourist visa, is about 1 in 4.1 million per year. Compared to foreign‐born terrorists, the chance of being murdered by a native‐born terrorist is about 1 in 28 million per year. Moreover, there were 192 foreign‐born terrorists, relative to the 788 native-born terrorists, who planned, attempted, or carried out attacks on U.S. soil from 1975 through 2017. Through a cost-benefit risk analysis, it was also found that the combined human, property, business, and economic costs of terrorism from 1975 through 2017 are estimated at USD216.58 billion. Spread over 43 years, the average annual cost of terrorism is USD5.04 billion, which is about one‐hundredth the minimum estimated yearly benefit of $553.9 billion from immigration and tourism. Therefore, foreign‐born terrorism on U.S. soil is a low‐probability event that imposes high costs on its victims, despite relatively small risks. \n\n## VAR Model Justification\n\nUsing a VAR model over an ARIMAX model for this research has a multitude of benefits, including:\n\n* Simultaneous modeling of multivariate time series: VAR allows for the simultaneous modeling of multiple endogenous variables, whereas ARIMAX (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variables) can only model one dependent variable at a time. This means that VAR can capture the complex relationships between multiple variables that may be influencing each other.\n\n* Better handling of lags: VAR can handle multiple lags in the data more efficiently than ARIMAX. This is important in the case of studying the impact of terrorist attacks, as the effects of a single attack may persist over a longer period of time and may have delayed impacts on different variables.\n\n* More robust to missing data: VAR can handle missing data more effectively than ARIMAX, as it does not require the same level of complete data in order to estimate the model parameters. This is particularly relevant in the case of studying the impact of terrorist attacks, as data may be missing or incomplete for certain variables in certain time periods.\n\n* Better captures dynamic relationships: VAR is better suited for capturing the dynamic relationships between variables over time, whereas ARIMAX can only capture the static relationships between variables at a particular point in time. This is important in the case of studying the impact of terrorist attacks, as the relationships between variables may change over time due to factors such as changes in government policies or public opinion.\n\n* No clear seasonality: Another reason why the VAR model is justified is that there may not be a clear seasonality pattern in the data related to terrorist attacks. This means that traditional time-series models may not be effective in capturing the complex relationships between the variables. The VAR model, on the other hand, does not rely on a specific seasonal pattern and can account for the complex relationships between variables without requiring seasonal adjustments. Moreover, the data that will be analyzed is aggregated yearly from 1970 to 2020, which makes it more difficult to identify and capture seasonal patterns. Yearly data may also be influenced by other factors that are not related to seasonality, such as long-term trends or cyclical patterns, that occur over longer periods of time. This can make it more challenging to distinguish between seasonal effects and other underlying factors that may be driving the data.\n\n* Non-linearity: The relationships between variables in the case of terrorist attacks may not be linear, and traditional linear models may not be able to capture the non-linear effects. The VAR model is capable of modeling non-linear relationships between variables and can account for the complex interactions that may exist between them.\n\n## Building the VAR Model \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Time Series Plots\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ARIMAX-SARIMAX-VAR_files/figure-html/tsplots-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Pairs Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"plotly html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-9efc9edc7b732794bad6\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-9efc9edc7b732794bad6\">{\"x\":{\"visdat\":{\"278d7b2f5fb6\":[\"function () \",\"plotlyVisDat\"]},\"cur_data\":\"278d7b2f5fb6\",\"attrs\":{\"278d7b2f5fb6\":{\"diagonal\":{\"visible\":false},\"dimensions\":[{\"label\":\"# Casualties\",\"values\":{}},{\"label\":\"# Attacks\",\"values\":{}},{\"label\":\"Tourists DHS\",\"values\":{}},{\"label\":\"Business DHS\",\"values\":{}},{\"label\":\"Students DHS\",\"values\":{}},{\"label\":\"RTX\",\"values\":{}}],\"alpha_stroke\":1,\"sizes\":[10,100],\"spans\":[1,20],\"type\":\"splom\"}},\"layout\":{\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10},\"hovermode\":\"x\",\"title\":\"Scatterplot Matrix of VAR Time Series Variables\",\"xaxis\":{\"title\":\"\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":\"\"},\"showlegend\":false},\"source\":\"A\",\"config\":{\"modeBarButtonsToAdd\":[\"hoverclosest\",\"hovercompare\"],\"showSendToCloud\":false},\"data\":[{\"diagonal\":{\"visible\":false},\"dimensions\":[{\"label\":\"# Casualties\",\"values\":[33,20,10,45,16,24,4,5,8,18,14,8,10,8,3,3,1,1,1,3,5,26,2,28,10,178,2,2,4,20,8,3014,4,0,0,0,1,0,2,22,4,0,7,23,26,54,68,98,45,53,12]},{\"label\":\"# Attacks\",\"values\":[464,246,65,58,92,149,105,129,86,69,66,70,77,44,63,40,49,33,26,41,31,31,31,21,54,57,35,42,31,51,42,47,33,35,9,20,6,11,18,12,16,9,20,20,29,41,68,66,76,72,103]},{\"label\":\"Tourists DHS\",\"values\":[9515170,9515170,9515170,9515170,9515170,9515170,9515170,9515170,9515170,9515170,9515170,9515170,8788525,8061880,7335235,6608590,7985088.5,9361587,10738085.5,12114584,13418328,14618065,16440997,16918351,17154834,17611536,19110004,14312587,9515170,23643561,22335763.6666667,21027966.3333333,19720169,19981833,22653699,23701858,24788438,27486177,29442168,27800027,35131310,40578964,42025488,48346018,59784922,61017237,61029117,61600219,64819854,64864687,28731613]},{\"label\":\"Business DHS\",\"values\":[1135422,1135422,1135422,1135422,1135422,1135422,1135422,1135422,1135422,1135422,1135422,1135422,1300771.25,1466120.5,1631469.75,1796819,1985794,2174769,2363744,2552719,2661338,2616335,2788069,2961092,3164099,3275336,3770326,4077931,4385536,4554517,4486074.33333333,4417631.66666667,4349189,4198988,4576783,4684164,5030779,5418884,5603668,4390888,5205980,5694809,5705106,6299533,7734191,8008659,8290712,8456038,8967224,9059770,4209153]},{\"label\":\"Students DHS\",\"values\":[240805,240805,240805,240805,240805,240805,240805,240805,240805,240805,240805,240805,244871,248937,253003,257069,276402.25,295735.5,315068.75,334402,326264,343238,368686,370620,394001,364220,426903,512711.5,598520,641760,699953,741921,687506,662966,656373,663919,740724,841673,917373,951964,1595078,1788962,1653576,1669225,1837664,1990661,1991940,1940171,1957852,1907176,918442]},{\"label\":\"RTX\",\"values\":[0.136338,0.125117,0.118484,0.111851,0.165332,0.245645,0.427321,0.468292666666667,0.509264333333333,0.550236,0.816227,0.585845,0.839921,1.0007855,1.16165,1.437607,1.556819,1.182128,1.40898266666667,1.63583733333333,1.862692,2.194055,1.999996,2.664417,3.82393633333333,4.98345566666667,6.142975,6.861031,10.402703,12.579855,12.7098895,12.839924,12.490479,19.409124,21.493523,25.4813643333333,29.4692056666667,33.457047,23.925987,31.86618,37.020092,38.7639105,40.507729,57.465122,59.32259,50.751022,53.9815366666667,57.2120513333333,60.442566,86.929314,67.844963]}],\"type\":\"splom\",\"marker\":{\"color\":\"rgba(31,119,180,1)\",\"line\":{\"color\":\"rgba(31,119,180,1)\"}},\"frame\":null}],\"highlight\":{\"on\":\"plotly_click\",\"persistent\":false,\"dynamic\":false,\"selectize\":false,\"opacityDim\":0.2,\"selected\":{\"opacity\":1},\"debounce\":0},\"shinyEvents\":[\"plotly_hover\",\"plotly_click\",\"plotly_selected\",\"plotly_relayout\",\"plotly_brushed\",\"plotly_brushing\",\"plotly_clickannotation\",\"plotly_doubleclick\",\"plotly_deselect\",\"plotly_afterplot\",\"plotly_sunburstclick\"],\"base_url\":\"https://plot.ly\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Multicollinearity!
