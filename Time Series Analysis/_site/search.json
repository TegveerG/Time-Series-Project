Several factors led to a surge in Ethereum buying in 2020 and especially in 2021. Younger Americans receiving three rounds of direct stimulus payments have poured a significant chunk of that cash into investments, including Ethereum. In addition, cryptocurrency investing became extremely trendy in 2021, and Ethereum was one of the most popular cryptos in the market. At the beginning of 2020, Ethereum was trading around $129. By the beginning of March, the cryptocurrency had risen to $218 as news of the virus spreading in China prompted concerns about a U.S. pandemic. On March 13, 2020, Ethereum plummeted to its pandemic low of $88.50 as global stock markets tanked. The good news for Ethereum investors is the crypto bounced off that level as the stock market began to stabilize shortly thereafter and the government started printing money."

Its relationship with tourism is intricate and multi-dimensional. Interestingly, international terrorism and tourism share common traits, such as being transnational in nature, involving citizens from different nations, and utilizing travel and communication technologies. The impact of terrorist attacks extends to several other industries related to tourism, including airlines, hotels, restaurants, and tourist-oriented shops and services (Baker, n.d.).\n\nBaker, David. n.d. “The Effects of Terrorism on the Travel and Tourism Industry.” International Journal of Religious Tourism and Pilgrimage. https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=ijrtp.\n\n“World Tourism Organization.” n.d. UNWTO. https://www.unwto.org/.\nReceipts from international tourism in destinations around the world grew by 4% in 2012 reaching USD 1,075 billion. This growth is equal to a 4% increase in international tourist arrivals over the previous year which reached 1,035 million in 2012. An additional USD 219 billion was recorded in receipts from international passenger transport, bringing total exports generated by international tourism in 2012 to US$ 1.3 trillion (“World Tourism Organization,” n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Global Terrorism Database™ (GTD) (“Codebook Methodology Inclusion Criteria and Variables - UMD,” n.d.) defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a nonstate actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. In practice this means in order to consider an incident for inclusion in the GTD (“Codebook Methodology Inclusion Criteria and Variables - UMD,” n.d.), all three of the following attributes must be present:\n\nThe incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator.\nThe incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence, including property violence, as well as violence against people.\nThe perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. The database does not include acts of state terrorism.\n\nIn addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD (“Codebook Methodology Inclusion Criteria and Variables - UMD,” n.d.):\n\n“Codebook Methodology Inclusion Criteria and Variables - UMD.” n.d. Global Terrorism Database. University of Maryland. https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf.\n\nCriterion 1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.\nCriterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.\nCriterion 3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law, insofar as it targets non-combatants"

    "text": "In order to collect time-series data on terrorism, choosing The Global Terrorism Database™ (GTD) by University of Maryland was a pragmatic decision because it contains detailed information of global attacks that occurred daily. This gave enormous flexibility to search for short-term seasonal patterns, if any, regarding terrorist attacks. For assessing the impact of terrorism on economic activity, the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database was employed. Military expenditure as a share of GDP can provide key insights about a country’s allocation of resources. Nonimmigrant Admissions data was also collected from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to add an extra dimension of how the sentiment of the US government changed regarding tourist admits in the overall analysis.\nThe Quantmod R package seamlessly allows R users to get stock data, which aids in exploring both changes in prices due to certain terror attacks and how weapons manufacturing companies reacted to these attacks. To analyze domestic financial impacts from terror attacks at a granular level, daily historical stock prices of some of the largest weapons manufacturers in the United States, including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies, were obtained. Not only stock prices of individual companies, but also data of the Dow Jones U.S. Travel & Tourism Index was gathered to approach the financial analysis at a larger scale."

Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, public sentiment in the US was marked by a strong sense of shock, anger, and a desire for justice, along with a surge in patriotism and a willingness to support government actions to prevent future terrorist attacks. There was also a significant increase in concerns about national security and a greater willingness to sacrifice personal freedoms in the interest of greater security. The figure below conveys that, immediately after 9/11, a share of the US public’s stance on venturing outdoors and travelling overseas stagnated for the next decade.

    "text": "Visualizing the GTD™\nFor the purpose of this project, the focus will be on the United States, so the data has been filtered accordingly. An important point to keep in mind is that incidents of terrorism from 1993 are not present in the GTD™ because they were lost by the authors. Hence, few visualizations created in R, using the GTD™, do reflect this aberration, as missing values for the year 1993 were not imputed.\nTo start, the visualizations below provide a general overview of how the number of terrorist attacks and fatalities have changed over time.\n\nEvolution of Volume of Terrorist Attacks and Fatalaties (1970-2020) in the US\n\nNumber of Monthly Attacks and FatalitiesNumber of Monthly Attacks and Fatalities (adjusted for 9/11)Cumulative Count of Terrorist Attacks & Fatalities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first plot (Number of Monthly Attacks and Fatalities) conveys the significance of the 9/11 Attacks on US history. The big black spike in fatalities, totaling approximately 3000, is representative of the attack and an “outlier” from both series. As a result, in order to depict the trend of both series clearly, it was imperative to filter out the 9/11 Attacks and that is why the second plot was created. A cumulative graph of number of attacks and fatalities is showcased as well that provides further context about the impact of the 9/11 Attacks. Total fatalities were much lower than total number of attakcs from 1970 to 2000, but the toll of the 9/11 Attacks were significant enough to surpass the 2,424 attacks that occurred up until the tragedy.\nMoreover, the total number of fatalities between 1970 and 2000 was 492 and the total number of fatalities between 2001 and 2020 was 419, suggesting that attacks apart from 9/11 follow a similar trend in death rate. Lastly, the number of attacks between the years 1976 and 2004 follow a concave shape, implying that the volume of attacks must be diminishing through the years. However, a steep, exponential rise in not only the number of attacks but also the number of fatalities is noticed after 2004!\nHere are a few facts (“Terrorist Attacks in the u.s Between 1970 and 2013: Data from the ... - DHS,” n.d.) attacks in the US between 1970 and 2013:\n\nApproximately 85% of all deaths from terrorist attacks during this period occurred in the coordinated attacks on September 11, 2001.\nNearly 80% of all terrorist attacks involved no casualties (fatalities or injuries).\nMore than half of terrorist attacks took place during the 1970s. Between 2000 and 2013, there were fewer than 20 attacks per year on average.\n\n\n\nEvolution of Terrorist Attacks: Approach, Victims, and Weapons (Raw Counts)\n\nNumber of Distinct Attacks Over TimeTrends in Attacks Over Time by Victim TypeTrends in Attacks Over Time by Weapon Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above bar chart races allow for an animated way to display the number of attacks changing over time by the categorical variables, Attack Type, Victim Type, and Weapon Type. The 1970s and 1980s were dominated by Bombing/Explosion Terrorist Attacks in the US, with Facility/Infrastructure Attacks gaining momentum by the end of the 1980s. Many of these bombings were carried out by leftist extremist groups, such as the Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army, who were motivated by a variety of political and social causes, including opposition to the Vietnam War, racial injustice, and government oppression (Serrano 2008).\n\nSerrano, Richard A. 2008. “The 1970s Bombing Spree.” Los Angeles Times.\n\nRosenau, William. n.d. “Leftist Terrorism in the United States.” Taylor &Amp; Francis. The Journal of Strategic Studies (2013). https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/fjss20.\nOne factor that contributed to the prevalence of domestic bombing attacks during this period was the rise of radical political activism and social unrest. The Vietnam War was a major source of division in American society, and many activists were inspired to use violent tactics in their protests. Additionally, the civil rights movement and the Black Power movement brought attention to issues of racial inequality, and some extremist groups sought to further their agendas through bombings and other violent actions. Another factor was the relative ease with which these groups could obtain explosives and other materials necessary to carry out bombings. Many of the bombs used in these attacks were constructed using readily available materials such as dynamite and pipe bombs, and there were few restrictions on the purchase of these materials at the time (Rosenau, n.d.).\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a majority of the victims of these attacks included businesses (corporate offices, restaurants, gas stations, bars, cafés, etc.), the government (government building, government member, former members, or events sponsored by political parties, etc.), and private citizens and property (the public in general or attacks in public areas including markets, commercial streets, busy intersections and pedestrian malls) (“Codebook Methodology Inclusion Criteria and Variables - UMD,” n.d.). Moreover, numerous attacks on abortion clinics were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s by anti-abortion activists. These attacks took various forms, including bombings, arson, and other acts of violence, as well as peaceful protests and acts of civil disobedience. Another factor that contributed to the attacks on abortion clinics was the political and legal context of the time. In 1973, the US Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to abortion. This decision was highly controversial and sparked a wave of political and social activism on both sides of the issue.\n\n“Codebook Methodology Inclusion Criteria and Variables - UMD.” n.d. Global Terrorism Database. University of Maryland. https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf.\nFrom recent years, the data portrays an increase in attacks against both Religious Figures/Institutions and the police. Therefore, terrorists’ aims and agendas have transformed over time as the underlying narrative of a country’s political climate changes. In a smaller sense, to conduct an attack, the US has also suffered from the evolution of weapons used by terrorists. As aforementioned, the 1970s and 1980s experienced bombings as the majority of attacks and the weapons used during that time support this finding. Explosives and incendiaries made up the majority of weapons used in the 1970s and 1980s, with firearms gaining traction. By the late 90s, less use of explosives is seen and a shift to incendiaries, firearms, chemical, and biological weapons becomes prominent.\nHere are some more facts (“Terrorist Attacks in the u.s Between 1970 and 2013: Data from the ... - DHS,” n.d.) related to the bar chart races:\n\n“Terrorist Attacks in the u.s Between 1970 and 2013: Data from the ... - DHS.” n.d.

Several time series packages exist in the R software that have been utilized to unravel deeper details about the data sets. Some of the famous time series analysis methods used in this section include decomposing and identifying time series components, producing auto-correlation function (ACF) and partial auto-correlation function (PACF) plots, and differencing, and checking for stationarity by the use of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test.\nCode for this section can be found here"

Therefore, monthly attack counts for the year 1993 have been interpolated using the na.approx() function from the zoo library in R. Appendix II of the GTD Codebook provides Country-level statistics for 1993 and for the US, the attack count was 28.

From these insights, the series does not seem stationary. Moreover, because we cannot identify whether the average length of cycles is longer than the length of a seasonal pattern, the graph is not cyclical. A stationary time series will have no predictable patterns in the long-term, but given the count of attacks now increasing in recent years, one could deduce or forecast patterns in the number of attacks for the next few months ahead from the present (Dec 2020). Lastly, as the time of the series increases, the seasonal variation remains fairly constant, so we should use an additive decomposition. Next, we shall take a look at this series’ lag plots to check for autocorrelations, if any."

Therefore, when windowing, we are applying a moving average to a moving average. One reason for doing this is to make an even-order moving average symmetric. Here we have employed a centered 4-month moving average followed by a centered 2-month moving average. Although this helps smooth out both seasonal and longer-term trends in the data, we notice some seasonality still being present in the smoothed overlay. Let’s us try to use other moving averaging windows to obtain a more stationary overlay.\n\n\nMoving Average Smoothing with Windowing (2x6)\n\n\n\n\n\nmonthly_attacks_ts_2\nma6\nma2x6\n\n\n\n\n26\nNA\nNA\n\n\n50\nNA\nNA\n\n\n54\n49.66667\nNA\n\n\n69\n54.00000\n51.83333\n\n\n61\n50.50000\n52.25000\n\n\n38\n44.83333\n47.66667\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe moving average did smooth out both seasonal and longer-term trends in the monthly time series.

The output is similar to that of the 2x6-MA. Let’s make our analysis more constrained by fitting 4x3-MA: A centered 3-month moving average repeated four times. This should smooth out both seasonal and shorter-term fluctuations even further, providing the least seasonal moving average out of all the other moving averages applied yet."

    "text": "After completing the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, the next step is to begin building time series models. In order to do so, one must first choose an appropriate model type, such as an ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) model or one of its variations, including ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).\nAn ARIMA model is generally notated as ARIMA(p,d,q) where p is the order of the AR process, d is the degree of differencing and q is the order of the MA process. The general equation of the model is given as follows:\n\\(\\phi(B)(1-B)^d x_t = \\delta + \\theta(B) w_t\\), where \\(B\\) is the backshift operator, \\(w_t\\) is the Gaussian white noise process, \\(\\delta\\) is the drift term and \\(\\phi(B)\\) and \\(\\theta(B)\\) correspond to the AR and MA parts respectively.\nLag plots, auto-correlation function (ACF) and partial auto-correlation function (PACF) plots, decomposing the time series, and differencing are all useful techniques that were employed during the EDA phase to help inform the choice of model type and parameters. With a solid understanding of the data and its characteristics, one can begin to develop and refine time series models that can be used for forecasting.\nCode for this section can be found here"

The equation of the model is given by:\n\\(\\begin{equation}(1-B)(1-B^1)y_t = \\delta + (1+\\phi_1B)(1-\\theta_1B-\\theta_2B^2)w_t\\end{equation}\\), where \\((1-B)\\) and \\((1-B^1)\\) are the differencing operators, which represent the first-order difference of the series. \\(y_t\\) is the time series, \\(\\delta\\) is the drift term, \\(\\phi_1\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\), \\(\\theta_2\\) are the parameters of the AR and MA parts, respectively, and \\(w_t\\) is the Gaussian white noise process.\nNote that \\(B\\) is the backshift operator, which shifts the time series back by one period.\n\n\nModel Diagnostics of ARIMA(1,1,2)\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardized Residuals: Essentially stating that if the errors are white noise. The model does look stationary as it captures all the signals and essentially captures the raw white noise.\nACF Of Residuals: Auto-correlation of the residuals. The only q value to inspect is 1.\nQ-Q Plot: The series follows a normal distribution pretty closely as even the tails seem to be on the normal line.\np values of the Ljung-Box statistic: Ideally, we would like to fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we would like to see the p-value of the test be greater than 0.05 because this means the residuals for our time series model are independent, which is often an assumption we make when creating a model. Since all lag values greater than 5 have a p-value greater than 0.05, our series is stationary.\n\n\nChecking Model Output of ARIMA(1,1,2) with auto.arima()\n\n\nModel metrics using auto.arima(): \n\n\nSeries: monthly_attacks_ts \nARIMA(1,1,1) \n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1      ma1\n      0.1389  -0.7431\ns.e.  0.0645   0.0432\n\nsigma^2 = 18.69:  log likelihood = -1760.85\nAIC=3527.7   AICc=3527.74   BIC=3540.95\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                    ME     RMSE      MAE  MPE MAPE    MASE       ACF1\nTraining set -0.154373 4.313143 2.764126 -Inf  Inf 0.72581 0.01754544\n\n\n\nModel metrics of ARIMA(1, 1, 2) using Arima(): \n\n\nSeries: dlx \nARIMA(1,1,2) \n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1      ma1     ma2\n      0.0327  -1.8568  0.8579\ns.e.  0.0503   0.0299  0.0292\n\nsigma^2 = 0.4:  log likelihood = -589.26\nAIC=1186.51   AICc=1186.58   BIC=1204.17\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                     ME      RMSE       MAE MPE MAPE      MASE         ACF1\nTraining set 0.05076924 0.6304084 0.5003311 NaN  Inf 0.5417286 -0.007967481\n\n\nFrom the above output, auto.arima() outputted an ARIMA(1,1,1) model, which is slightly simpler than the best model obtained with the Arima() function. In fact, the ARIMA(1,1,1) model was the worst model obtained using the Arima() function and that is noted in the table outputted in (best-fit?). This difference can be expected when using auto.arima() because it is not as reliable as the Arima() when building ARIMA models. The case is different when building SARIMA models, which is covered in the next section.\nThe best model outputted by Arima() performs significantly better than the model outputted by auto.arima() in terms of model selection metrics, including AIC, BIC, and AICc. Moreover, the best model outputted by Arima() also outperforms the model outputted by auto.arima() in terms of training set metrics, including RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Although the auto.arima() model does well to closely match the best Arima() model by including a differenced order in its model and by choosing the right p or AR order, it does not select an additional MA order that would make the model more robust, as seen by the comparison of metrics. Some points to keep in mind when using these functions is as follows.\nThe auto.arima() function in R uses a stepwise algorithm to search through the space of possible ARIMA models and select the one with the lowest AIC value. While this approach can be computationally efficient and provide a good starting point for model selection, it does not necessarily find the best possible model for a given time series.\nOn the other hand, the Arima() function in R allows you to specify the exact order of the ARIMA model and can be used to fit more complex models, such as those with seasonality, exogenous variables, or other constraints. By specifying the exact order of the model, you have more control over the modeling process and can potentially obtain a better fit to the data.\nIn summary, the auto.arima() function can be a useful tool for quickly identifying a potentially good model, but it is not a substitute for careful model selection and customization using the Arima() function.\n\n\nForecasting ARIMA(1,1,2)\n\n\n\n\n\n$pred\n            Jan        Feb        Mar        Apr        May        Jun\n2021 0.37759011 0.02555481 0.01273564 0.01231300 0.01234339 0.01239033\n2022 0.01272329 0.01277086                                            \n            Jul        Aug        Sep        Oct        Nov        Dec\n2021 0.01243788 0.01248544 0.01253301 0.01258058 0.01262815 0.01267572\n2022                                                                  \n\n$se\n           Jan       Feb       Mar       Apr       May       Jun       Jul\n2021 0.6282655 0.8166695 0.8168888 0.8168890 0.8168890 0.8168890 0.8168890\n2022 0.8168890 0.8168890                                                  \n           Aug       Sep       Oct       Nov       Dec\n2021 0.8168890 0.8168890 0.8168890 0.8168890 0.8168890\n2022                                                  \n\n\nFrom the above graph, we can note that the number of attacks will fluctuate anywhere between 0 to 6 (converting from log data) every month from 2021 to 2022, as per the 95% confidence bound. A spike is noticed for the first observed forecast after which the model does poorly to forecast the rest of the year. Since the ARIMA(1,1,2) is relatively simple, it is not as robust and complex to forecast more than a month into the future. The straight red line forecast after the first forecasted month suggests that 1 attack per month (converting from log data) would take place, an averaged out value. This is expected.\nMoreover, the other suboptimal models outputted by Arima() also give the same forecast, so overlaying them onto the above plot would be redundant. It is, however, pragmatic to check whether the auto.arima() model’s forecast may forecast differently. Let us find out below.\n\n\nForecasting ARIMA(1,1,1) Outputted by auto.arima()\n\n\n\n\n\n$pred\n              Jan          Feb          Mar          Apr          May\n2021  0.160739303 -0.066511129  0.048747789 -0.009617016  0.020030951\n2022  0.010443266  0.010418886                                       \n              Jun          Jul          Aug          Sep          Oct\n2021  0.005063770  0.012712754  0.008897226  0.010893251  0.009943302\n2022                                                                 \n              Nov          Dec\n2021  0.010486717  0.010273121\n2022                          \n\n$se\n           Jan       Feb       Mar       Apr       May       Jun       Jul\n2021 0.7049204 0.7897960 0.8104291 0.8155169 0.8168849 0.8172028 0.8173013\n2022 0.8173278 0.8173277                                                  \n           Aug       Sep       Oct       Nov       Dec\n2021 0.8173181 0.8173267 0.8173267 0.8173278 0.8173276\n2022                                                  \n\n\nLike the previous forecast, we can note that, for the auto.arima() model, the number of attacks will fluctuate anywhere between 0 to 6 every month from 2021 to 2022 (again this is logged data), as per the 95% confidence bound. However, from the above plot, it can be discerned from red line that the auto.arima() model’s forecasts fluctuate more for the initial months’ forecasts than that of the Arima() model’s forecasts, which was smoother for the initial 2 months. Like the Arima() model’s forecasts, the the auto.arima() model’s forecast then lie on a single value, 1 attack per month, as the red line flattens out. Note that the output of the auto.arima() model was ARIMA(1,1,1), so it was expected that the forecast would be slightly less smoother than the ARIMA(1,1,2) model outputted by Arima(). This is attributed to the fact that ARIMA(1,1,2) has an additional Moving-Average term, which help make its forecasts smoother.\n\n\nComparing ARIMA(1,1,2) with Benchmarks\n\n\n\n\n\nBest model metrics: \n\n\nSeries: dlx \nARIMA(1,1,2) \n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1      ma1     ma2\n      0.0327  -1.8568  0.8579\ns.e.  0.0503   0.0299  0.0292\n\nsigma^2 = 0.4:  log likelihood = -589.26\nAIC=1186.51   AICc=1186.58   BIC=1204.17\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                     ME      RMSE       MAE MPE MAPE      MASE         ACF1\nTraining set 0.05076924 0.6304084 0.5003311 NaN  Inf 0.5417286 -0.007967481\n\n\n\nSnaive metrics: \n\n\n                       ME     RMSE       MAE MPE MAPE MASE       ACF1\nTraining set -0.000351788 1.145667 0.9235824 NaN  Inf    1 -0.5112064\n\n\nFrom the above plot, only the Snaive benchmark method’s forecasts seem more plausible compared to that of the ARIMA(1,1,2) model. The forecasts produced from the Snaive benchmark have the greatest amount of fluctuations or seasonality in a higher range of number of monthly attacks. However, the metrics paint a different story. The ARIMA(1,1,2) model’s training error measures are better than those of the Snaive benchmark. There are several reasons for this phenomenon:\nModel Assumptions: The ARIMA model assumes that the data is stationary, which means that the mean and variance of the data do not change over time. If the data violates this assumption, the ARIMA model may not perform well. In contrast, the Snaive model does not assume stationarity, which may make it more robust to non-stationary data.\nParameter Estimation: The ARIMA model has three parameters (p, d, q) that need to be estimated, whereas the Snaive model has only one parameter (the seasonality). It is possible that the parameter estimation process for the ARIMA model was not optimal, leading to suboptimal forecast performance.\nForecast Horizon: The Snaive model may perform better than the ARIMA model for shorter forecast horizons, while the ARIMA model may perform better for longer forecast horizons. This is because the Snaive model assumes that the future values of the time series will be the same as the past values at the same time of year, which may be a reasonable assumption for short forecast horizons, but not for longer ones."

This model is a pure moving average model with first-order differencing and a single lagged moving average term. Therefore, the model has no autoregressive terms, i.e., it does not use the past values of the variable to predict its future values. It uses only the difference between the current and previous values of the variable and the error term to make the forecast. Although, according to both AIC and AICc metrics, the ARIMA(2,1,3) model is better, we shall choose our model using the BIC metric because BIC is more stringent than AIC in penalizing the number of parameters used in the model, making it more effective in helping reduce overfitting.\nARIMA(2,1,3) is a time series model that involves taking the first-order difference of the series, using two Autoregressive (AR) terms and three Moving Average (MA) terms. This means that the model uses not only the past two values of the variable, but also the past three errors to make the forecast. The inclusion of the MA terms allows the model to capture the influence of random shocks or noise in the data. However, including too many autoregressive terms may lead to overfitting, which can result in poor forecast performance and we shall explore that in the next few sections\nThe choice between ARIMA(0,1,1) and ARIMA(2,1,3) depends on the nature of the data and the performance of the models in terms of RMSE or other error metrics. If the data has a clear trend, then including Autoregressive terms may improve the forecast accuracy. On the other hand, if the data is more random, then a simpler model like ARIMA(0,1,1) may be sufficient. There is a clear decreasing trend of monthly terrorist attacks from the 1970s to 2015, with random and/or seasonal fluctuations, but the number of attacks does start increasing sharply after 2015. Therefore, no single pattern is discerned along the entire series and, moreover, we shall be abiding by the principle of parsimony if we select ARIMA(0,1,1) as the best model.\nThe equation of the ARIMA(0,1,1) model is given by:\n\\(\\begin{equation}(1-B)(1-\\theta_1B)X_t = \\omega_t\\end{equation}\\), giving us:\n\\(\\begin{equation}\\left(1-\\theta_1B+B-\\theta_1B^2\\right)X_t = \\omega_t\\end{equation}\\), giving us:\n\\(\\begin{equation}\\left(1-\\theta_1B\\right)X_t - B\\left(1-\\theta_1B\\right)X_t = \\omega_t\\end{equation}\\), giving us:\n\\(\\begin{equation}X_t - \\theta_1X_{t-1} - B\\left(X_{t-1}-\\theta_1X_{t-2}\\right) = \\omega_t\\end{equation}\\), finally substituting the MA(1) values from the model’s summary:\n\\(\\begin{equation}X_t = -0.8436X_{t-1} + X_{t-1} + 0.8436X_{t-2} + \\omega_t\\end{equation}\\), where \\((1-B)\\) is the differencing operator, which represents the first-order difference of the series. \\(X_t\\) is the time series, \\(\\theta_1\\) is the parameter of the MA component, and \\(\\omega_t\\) is the Gaussian white noise process.\nNote that \\(B\\) is the backshift operator, which shifts the time series back by one period.\n\n\nModel Diagnostics of ARIMA(0,1,1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconverged\n$fit\n\nCall:\narima(x = xdata, order = c(p, d, q), seasonal = list(order = c(P, D, Q), period = S), \n    xreg = constant, transform.pars = trans, fixed = fixed, optim.control = list(trace = trc, \n        REPORT = 1, reltol = tol))\n\nCoefficients:\n          ma1  constant\n      -0.8453   -0.0028\ns.e.   0.0239    0.0041\n\nsigma^2 estimated as 0.3982:  log likelihood = -562.33,  aic = 1130.67\n\n$degrees_of_freedom\n[1] 584\n\n$ttable\n         Estimate     SE  t.value p.value\nma1       -0.8453 0.0239 -35.3385  0.0000\nconstant  -0.0028 0.0041  -0.6943  0.4877\n\n$AIC\n[1] 1.929468\n\n$AICc\n[1] 1.929504\n\n$BIC\n[1] 1.951857\n\n\nStandardized Residuals: Essentially stating that if the errors are white noise.

The only q value to inspect is 1.\nQ-Q Plot: The series follows a normal distribution pretty closely as even the tails seem to be on the normal line.\np values of the Ljung-Box statistic: Ideally, we would like to fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we would like to see the p-value of the test be greater than 0.05 because this means the residuals for our time series model are independent, which is often an assumption we make when creating a model. Since all lag values greater than 5 have a p-value greater than 0.05, the residuals have no remaining autocorrelations.\nThe only MA term in the ARIMA(0,1,1) model is also significant at the \\(\\alpha\\)=5% level as shown by its p-value = 0.

The ACF of residuals for ARIMA(2,1,3), although, has spikes less significant than ARIMA(0,1,1) and the p-values for Ljung-Box test for ARIMA(2,1,3) are higher than those of ARIMA(0,1,1). However, a key difference is that only the MA(1) term in the ARIMA(2,1,3) model is significant at the \\(\\alpha\\)=5% level as shown by its p-value = 0.0004 and all other terms are not significant. Therefore, a simpler model, ARIMA(0,1,1), would be a better fit to the log of monthly attacks series.\nLet’s see what model is outputted by auto.arima().\n\n\nChecking Model Output of Log Monthly Attacks with auto.arima()\n\n\nModel metrics using auto.arima(): \n\n\nSeries: lx \nARIMA(0,1,1) \n\nCoefficients:\n          ma1\n      -0.8436\ns.e.   0.0240\n\nsigma^2 = 0.3992:  log likelihood = -562.57\nAIC=1129.15   AICc=1129.17   BIC=1137.89\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                     ME      RMSE       MAE  MPE MAPE      MASE       ACF1\nTraining set -0.0182295 0.6307598 0.4949849 -Inf  Inf 0.7886882 0.01012716\n\n\nFrom the above output, auto.arima() too outputted an ARIMA(0,1,1) model, which is is the best model returned by the Arima() function in terms of lowest BIC (best-fit?). Some points to keep in mind when using these functions is as follows:\nThe auto.arima() function in R uses a stepwise algorithm to search through the space of possible ARIMA models and select the one with the lowest AIC value. While this approach can be computationally efficient and provide a good starting point for model selection, it does not necessarily always find the best possible model for a given time series.\nOn the other hand, the Arima() function in R allows us to specify the exact order of the ARIMA model and can be used to fit more complex models, such as those with seasonality, exogenous variables, or other constraints. By specifying the exact order of the model, we have more control over the modeling process and can potentially obtain a better fit to the data.\nIn summary, the auto.arima() function can be a useful tool for quickly identifying a potentially good model, but it is not a substitute for careful model selection and customization seen when using the Arima() function.\n\n\nForecasting ARIMA(0,1,1) and ARIMA(2,1,3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above graph, we can note that the forecasted number of attacks remains constant at around 1 for both models on the test set (October 2010 to December 2020). This performance is not what was expected and, hence, it is possible that the models are not able to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as insufficient data and the models not being complex enough to capture the variation in the data. It is, however, pragmatic to check whether the sarima.for() function’s predictions may forecast differently. Let us find out below.\n\n\nForecasting ARIMA(0,1,1) using sarima.for()\n\n\n\n\n\n$pred\n          Jan      Feb      Mar      Apr      May      Jun      Jul      Aug\n2018                                                                        \n2019 1.954087 1.951260 1.948432 1.945605 1.942778 1.939950 1.937123 1.934296\n2020 1.920159 1.917332 1.914505 1.911678 1.908850 1.906023 1.903196 1.900368\n          Sep      Oct      Nov      Dec\n2018                            1.956914\n2019 1.931469 1.928641 1.925814 1.922987\n2020 1.897541 1.894714 1.891886         \n\n$se\n           Jan       Feb       Mar       Apr       May       Jun       Jul\n2018                                                                      \n2019 0.6385446 0.6459664 0.6533040 0.6605600 0.6677372 0.6748381 0.6818650\n2020 0.7225930 0.7291599 0.7356681 0.7421193 0.7485148 0.7548562 0.7611448\n           Aug       Sep       Oct       Nov       Dec\n2018                                         0.6310354\n2019 0.6888203 0.6957060 0.7025242 0.7092769 0.7159659\n2020 0.7673818 0.7735685 0.7797062 0.7857959          \n\n\nLike the previous forecast, we can note that sarima.for() too does not accurately capture the inherent randomness and/or seasonality in the series and, hence, it outputs a highly linear, downward trending forecast. As per its 95% confidence bound, the number of attacks will fluctuate anywhere between 3 to 12 attacks every month from 2019 to end of 2020 (keep in mind that the plot is log of monthly attacks).\n\n\nComparing ARIMA(0,1,1) with Benchmarks\n\n\n\n\n\nARIMA(0,1,1) model metrics: \n\n\nSeries: log_monthly_attacks \nARIMA(0,1,1) \n\nCoefficients:\n          ma1\n      -0.8436\ns.e.   0.0240\n\nsigma^2 = 0.3992:  log likelihood = -562.57\nAIC=1129.15   AICc=1129.17   BIC=1137.89\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                     ME      RMSE       MAE  MPE MAPE      MASE       ACF1\nTraining set -0.0182295 0.6307598 0.4949849 -Inf  Inf 0.7143174 0.01012716\n\n\n\nMean metrics: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Ljung-Box test\n\ndata:  Residuals from Mean\nQ* = 2327.6, df = 23, p-value < 2.2e-16\n\nModel df: 1.

The forecasts produced from the Snaive benchmark have the greatest amount of fluctuations or seasonality in a higher range of number of monthly attacks. However, the metrics paint a different story. The ARIMA(0,1,1) model’s training error measures are better than those of all the benchmarks. There are several reasons for this phenomenon:\nModel Assumptions: The ARIMA model assumes that the data is stationary, which means that the mean and variance of the data do not change over time. If the data violates this assumption, the ARIMA model may not perform well. In contrast, the Snaive model does not assume stationarity, which may make it more robust to non-stationary data.\nParameter Estimation: The ARIMA model has three parameters (p, d, q) that need to be estimated, whereas the Snaive model has only one parameter (the seasonality). It is possible that the parameter estimation process for the ARIMA model was not optimal, leading to suboptimal forecast performance.\nForecast Horizon: The Snaive model may perform better than the ARIMA model for shorter forecast horizons, while the ARIMA model may perform better for longer forecast horizons. This is because the Snaive model assumes that the future values of the time series will be the same as the past values at the same time of year, which may be a reasonable assumption for short forecast horizons, but not for longer ones."

    "text": "Global Terrorism Database SARIMA Modeling\n\nVisualizing Seasonal Components of Monthly Attacks\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above seasonal component graph of the number of monthly terrorist attacks, we notice there does exist some level of seasonality in the original series. The seasonal component graph illustrates the degree of seasonal variation in the number of terrorist attacks. The magnitude of the seasonal variation is shown on the y-axis of the graph, and it indicates how much the number of terrorist attacks deviates from the average value for each season. The graph shows a repeating pattern in the number of terrorist attacks over time, with clear peaks in the first and second quarters and troughs in the third quarter. This pattern implies that the number of terrorist attacks in the US might be influenced by the season of the year.\n\n\nVisualizing Seasonally Differenced Monthly Attacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACF and PACF Plots of Seasonally Differenced Monthly Attacks\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter first ordinary differencing the original series (ACF?), we saw a lot of seasonal correlation left, suggesting that first order differencing did not help in transforming the raw data into a stationary series. This differenced series cannot be used for building a robust SARIMA model. Therefore, a seasonal differencing on the original monthly attacks was performed above and we can still notice some correlation left, but lesser compared to when the raw series was differenced with first order.

Although, according to both AIC and AICc metrics, the SARIMA(1,1,1,0,1,1) is better, we shall choose our model using the BIC metric because BIC is more stringent than AIC in penalizing the number of parameters used in the model, making it more effective in helping reduce overfitting. The equation of the SARIMA(0,1,1,0,1,1) model is given by:\n\\(\\begin{equation}(1-B)(1-B^1)y_t = \\delta + (1+\\phi_1B)(1-\\theta_1B-\\theta_2B^2)w_t\\end{equation}\\), where \\((1-B)\\) and \\((1-B^1)\\) are the differencing operators, which represent the first-order difference of the series. \\(y_t\\) is the time series, \\(\\delta\\) is the drift term, \\(\\phi_1\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\), \\(\\theta_2\\) are the parameters of the AR and MA parts, respectively, and \\(w_t\\) is the Gaussian white noise process.\nNote that \\(B\\) is the backshift operator, which shifts the time series back by one period.\n\n\nModel Diagnostics of ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardized Residuals: Essentially stating if the errors are white noise. The model does look stationary as it captures all the signals and essentially captures the raw white noise.\nACF Of Residuals: However, looking at the ACF of the Residuals gives us a definitive answer to whether the model is stationary. Because some spikes are not within the significance limits, the model is not being able to capture all the signal in the data. In fact, the ARIMA(1,1,2) model’s diagnostics (ARIMA-Diag?) are better than that of ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) above.\nQ-Q Plot: The series weakly follows a normal distribution as the tails waver away significantly from the normal line.\np values of the Ljung-Box statistic: Ideally, we would like to fail to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we would like to see the p-value of the test be greater than 0.05 because this means the residuals for our time series model are independent, which is often an assumption we make when creating a model. Since all lag values greater than 5 have a p-value less than 0.05, residuals have remaining autocorrelations.\n\n\nForecast for the next 3 years using ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)\n\n\nSeries: monthly_attacks_ts \nARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] \n\nCoefficients:\n          ma1     sma1\n      -0.6661  -0.9261\ns.e.   0.0374   0.0322\n\nsigma^2 = 19.11:  log likelihood = -1744.52\nAIC=3495.03   AICc=3495.07   BIC=3508.22\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                    ME     RMSE      MAE MPE MAPE      MASE       ACF1\nTraining set 0.4707554 4.317518 2.887572 NaN  Inf 0.7582246 0.07436485\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) with benchmarks\n\n\nBest model metrics: \n\n\n\n\n\nBest model metrics: \n\n\nSeries: monthly_attacks_ts \nARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] \n\nCoefficients:\n          ma1     sma1\n      -0.6661  -0.9261\ns.e.   0.0374   0.0322\n\nsigma^2 = 19.11:  log likelihood = -1744.52\nAIC=3495.03   AICc=3495.07   BIC=3508.22\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                    ME     RMSE      MAE MPE MAPE      MASE       ACF1\nTraining set 0.4707554 4.317518 2.887572 NaN  Inf 0.7582246 0.07436485\n\n\nSnaive metrics: \n\n\n                     ME     RMSE      MAE  MPE MAPE MASE      ACF1\nTraining set -0.6016667 6.093029 3.808333 -Inf  Inf    1 0.4168619\n\n\n\n\nSeasonal Cross Validation of ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) and ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) using 1 step ahead forecasts\n\n\nMAE for ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) is:  2.155092\n\n\n\nRMSE for ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) is:  7.428068\n\n\n\nMAE for ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) is:  2.092574\n\n\n\nRMSE for ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) is:  7.410171\n\n\nBoth MAE and RMSE metrics agree that ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) is the best model by a slight margin. However, the BIC metric does not agree with this result as it outputted ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) as the model with lowest BIC. AIC and AICc metrics, however, do agree with the MAE and RMSE metrics generated from Seasonal Cross Validation using 1 step ahead forecasts. Let’s see whether this is the case when forecasting 12 steps ahead.\n\n\nSeasonal Cross Validation of ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) and ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) using 12 steps (seasonal period) ahead forecasts\n\n\n[1] 537\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot gives cross-validation statistics up to horizon 12. The procedure for seasonal cross validation using 12 steps ahead is very similar to seasonal cross validation using 1 step ahead. We need to change the “h” parameter to the desired the number of time horizons we want to forecast for. The farima() function manually written by us helps us call our desired SARIMA model with the number of horizons. Then, farima() function is called inside the tsCV() function, which helps us store the cross-validated errors for up to 12 steps ahead. Then, because we get forecasts for each time horizon, we need to take the mean of the squared column using colMeans to obtain MSE.\nAlthough we observed that the MSE and RMSE of ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) when forecasting 1 step ahead was lower than that of ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1), from the above plot it can be seen that the cross-validated MSEs get lower or better as the number of forecasting steps increases. Both models’ MSE performance follow a very similar pattern, with ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1), picked by lowest BIC, having a lower MSE across all forecasting steps, except for step 1. Therefore, ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) is the better SARIMA model!"

The seasonal component graph illustrates the degree of seasonal variation in the number of terrorist attacks. The magnitude of the seasonal variation is shown on the y-axis of the graph, and it indicates how much the number of terrorist attacks deviates from the average value for each season. The graph shows a repeating pattern in the number of terrorist attacks over time, with clear peaks in the first and second quarters and troughs in the third quarter. This pattern implies that the number of terrorist attacks in the US might be influenced by the season of the year."

Since all lag values greater than 5 have a p-value less than 0.05, residuals have remaining autocorrelations.\n\n\nForecast for the next 3 years using ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)\n\nfit <- Arima(monthly_attacks_ts, order=c(0,1,1), seasonal=c(0,1,1))\nsummary(fit)\n\nSeries: monthly_attacks_ts \nARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] \n\nCoefficients:\n          ma1     sma1\n      -0.6661  -0.9261\ns.e.   0.0374   0.0322\n\nsigma^2 = 19.11:  log likelihood = -1744.52\nAIC=3495.03   AICc=3495.07   BIC=3508.22\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                    ME     RMSE      MAE MPE MAPE      MASE       ACF1\nTraining set 0.4707554 4.317518 2.887572 NaN  Inf 0.7582246 0.07436485\n\nfit %>% forecast(h=36) %>% autoplot() #next 3 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) with benchmarks\n\ncat(\"Best model metrics: \\n\")\n\nBest model metrics: \n\nfit <- Arima(monthly_attacks_ts, order=c(0,1,1), seasonal=c(0,1,1))\n\nautoplot(monthly_attacks_ts) +\n  autolayer(meanf(monthly_attacks_ts, h=36),\n            series=\"Mean\", PI=FALSE) +\n  autolayer(naive(monthly_attacks_ts, h=36),\n            series=\"Naïve\", PI=FALSE) +\n  autolayer(snaive(monthly_attacks_ts, h=36),\n            series=\"SNaïve\", PI=FALSE)+\n  autolayer(rwf(monthly_attacks_ts, h=36, drift=TRUE),\n            series=\"Drift\", PI=FALSE)+\n  autolayer(forecast(fit,36), \n            series=\"fit\",PI=FALSE) +\n  guides(colour=guide_legend(title=\"Forecast\"))\n\n\n\ncat(\"Best model metrics: \\n\")\n\nBest model metrics: \n\nsummary(fit)\n\nSeries: monthly_attacks_ts \nARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] \n\nCoefficients:\n          ma1     sma1\n      -0.6661  -0.9261\ns.e.   0.0374   0.0322\n\nsigma^2 = 19.11:  log likelihood = -1744.52\nAIC=3495.03   AICc=3495.07   BIC=3508.22\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                    ME     RMSE      MAE MPE MAPE      MASE       ACF1\nTraining set 0.4707554 4.317518 2.887572 NaN  Inf 0.7582246 0.07436485\n\ncat(\"Snaive metrics: \\n\")\n\nSnaive metrics: \n\nf2 <- snaive(monthly_attacks_ts, h=36) \n\naccuracy(f2)\n\n                     ME     RMSE      MAE  MPE MAPE MASE      ACF1\nTraining set -0.6016667 6.093029 3.808333 -Inf  Inf    1 0.4168619\n\n\n\n\nSeasonal Cross Validation of ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) and ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) using 1 step ahead forecasts\n\nk <- 75 # minimum data length for fitting a model \nn <- length(monthly_attacks_ts)\n#n-k # rest of the observations\n\nset.seed(133)\n\nfarima1 <- function(x, h){forecast(Arima(monthly_attacks_ts, order=c(0,1,1),seasonal=c(0,1,1)), h=h)}\ne <- tsCV(monthly_attacks_ts, farima1, h=1)\n\nMAE1 <-abs(mean(e,na.rm=TRUE))\ncat(\"MAE for ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) is: \", MAE1)\n\nMAE for ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) is:  2.155092\n\nRMSE1=sqrt(mean(e^2, na.rm=TRUE)) #one-step time series cross-validation\ncat(\"\\nRMSE for ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) is: \", RMSE1)\n\n\nRMSE for ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) is:  7.428068\n\nfarima2 <- function(x, h){forecast(Arima(monthly_attacks_ts, order=c(1,1,1),seasonal=c(0,1,1)), h=h)}\ne <- tsCV(monthly_attacks_ts, farima2, h=1)\n\nMAE2 <-abs(mean(e,na.rm=TRUE))\ncat(\"\\nMAE for ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) is: \", MAE2)\n\n\nMAE for ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) is:  2.092574\n\nRMSE2=sqrt(mean(e^2, na.rm=TRUE)) #one-step time series cross-validation\ncat(\"\\nRMSE for ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) is: \", RMSE2)\n\n\nRMSE for ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) is:  7.410171\n\n\nBoth MAE and RMSE metrics agree that ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) is the best model by a slight margin. However, the BIC metric does not agree with this result as it outputted ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) as the model with lowest BIC. AIC and AICc metrics, however, do agree with the MAE and RMSE metrics generated from Seasonal Cross Validation using 1 step ahead forecasts. Let’s see whether this is the case when forecasting 12 steps ahead.\n\n\nSeasonal Cross Validation of ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) and ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) using 12 steps (seasonal period) ahead forecasts\n\nk <- 75 # minimum data length for fitting a model \nn <- length(monthly_attacks_ts)\nn-k # rest of the observations\n\n[1] 537\n\nset.seed(133)\n\nfarima1 <- function(x, h){forecast(Arima(monthly_attacks_ts, order=c(0,1,1),seasonal=c(0,1,1)), h=h)}\n\n# Compute cross-validated errors for up to 12 steps ahead\ne <- tsCV(monthly_attacks_ts, forecastfunction = farima1, h = 12)\n\nmse1 <- colMeans(e^2, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nfarima2 <- function(x, h){forecast(Arima(monthly_attacks_ts, order=c(1,1,1),seasonal=c(0,1,1)), h=h)}\n# Compute cross-validated errors for up to 12 steps ahead\ne <- tsCV(monthly_attacks_ts, forecastfunction = farima2, h = 12)\n\n# Compute the MSE values and remove missing values\nmse2 <- colMeans(e^2, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Plot the MSE values against the forecast horizon\ndata.frame(h = 1:12, MSE1 = mse1, MSE2 = mse2) %>%\n  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(y=MSE1,x= h)) + geom_point(aes(y=MSE2,x= h)) +\n           geom_line(aes(y=MSE1,x= h,colour=\"MSE for ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)\")) + \n           geom_line(aes(y=MSE2,x= h,colour=\"MSE for ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1)\"))+\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThis plot gives cross-validation statistics up to horizon 12. The procedure for seasonal cross validation using 12 steps ahead is very similar to seasonal cross validation using 1 step ahead. We need to change the “h” parameter to the desired the number of time horizons we want to forecast for. The farima() function manually written by us helps us call our desired SARIMA model with the number of horizons. Then, farima() function is called inside the tsCV() function, which helps us store the cross-validated errors for up to 12 steps ahead. Then, because we get forecasts for each time horizon, we need to take the mean of the squared column using colMeans to obtain MSE.\nAlthough we observed that the MSE and RMSE of ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) when forecasting 1 step ahead was lower than that of ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1), from the above plot it can be seen that the cross-validated MSEs get lower or better as the number of forecasting steps increases. Both models’ MSE performance follow a very similar pattern, with ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1), picked by lowest BIC, having a lower MSE across all forecasting steps, except for step 1. Therefore, ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1) is the better SARIMA model!"

    "text": "After completing the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, the next step is to begin building time series models. In order to do so, one must first choose an appropriate model type, such as an ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) model or one of its variations, including ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).\nAn ARIMA model is generally notated as ARIMA(p,d,q) where p is the order of the AR process, d is the degree of differencing and q is the order of the MA process. The general equation of the model is given as follows:\n\\(\\phi(B)(1-B)^d x_t = \\delta + \\theta(B) w_t\\), where \\(B\\) is the backshift operator, \\(w_t\\) is the Gaussian white noise process, \\(\\delta\\) is the drift term and \\(\\phi(B)\\) and \\(\\theta(B)\\) correspond to the AR and MA parts respectively.\nLag plots, auto-correlation function (ACF) and partial auto-correlation function (PACF) plots, decomposing the time series, and differencing are all useful techniques that were employed during the EDA phase to help inform the choice of model type and parameters. With a solid understanding of the data and its characteristics, one can begin to develop and refine time series models that can be used for forecasting.\nCode for this section can be found here"
